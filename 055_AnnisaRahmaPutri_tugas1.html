    <h2 id="p1">Speculative Fiction</h2>
    <p>
        <b>S</b>peculative fiction is a supergenre that encompasses a number of different types of fiction, 
        from science fiction to fantasy to dystopian. The stories take place in a world different 
        from our own. Speculative fiction knows no boundaries; there are no limits to what exists 
        beyond the real world. Learn more about speculative fiction in Margaret Atwoods MasterClass.
        Speculative fiction is a broad category of fiction encompassing genres with elements that do 
        not exist in reality, recorded history, nature, or the present universe. Such fiction covers 
        various themes in the context of supernatural, futuristic, and other imaginative realms.

       Speculative fiction is often used as an umbrella term for genre fiction or for narratives that 
       do not fully belong in a particular science fiction or fantasy genre. I have even seen it referred 
       to as a “super genre,” for its broadness. Under this classification, it can include literary fiction 
       with fantastical elements as well as hardcore science fiction, fantasy, and horror. Also, there is 
       the distinction that not all of certain genres, such as horror or science fiction, is speculative.

    <h2 id="p2">Science Fiction</h2>
    <p>
        Sci-fi novels are speculative stories with imagined elements that dont exist in the real world. 
        Some are inspired by “hard” natural sciences like physics, chemistry, and astronomy; others are 
        inspired by “soft” social sciences like psychology, anthropology, and sociology. Common elements 
        of sci-fi novels include time travel, space exploration, and futuristic societies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Science fiction (sometimes shortened to sci-fi or SF) is a genre of speculative fiction which 
        typically deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology, 
        space exploration, time travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Part of the reason 
        that it is so difficult to pin down an agreed definition of science fiction is because there is a 
        tendency among science fiction enthusiasts to act as their own arbiter in deciding what exactly 
        constitutes science fiction.[8] Damon Knight summed up the difficulty, saying "science fiction is 
        what we point to when we say it."[9] Ultimately, it may be more useful to talk around science 
        fiction as the intersection of other, more concrete, genres and subgenres.

    <h2 id="p3">Magical Realism</h2>
    <p>
        Magical realism novels depict the world truthfully, plus add magical elements. The fantastical
       elements arent viewed as odd or unique; theyre considered normal in the world in which the story 
       takes place. The genre was born out of the realist art movement and is closely associated with 
       Latin American authors.Magic realism (also known as magical realism or marvelous realism) is a 20th-century style of 
       fiction and literary genre. The terms were influenced by an eponymous German painting style in 
       the 1920s. As a literary fiction style, magic realism paints a realistic view of the world 
       while also adding magical elements, often dealing with the blurring of the lines between fantasy 
       and reality. Magical realism, perhaps the most common term, often refers to literature in 
       particular, with magical or supernatural phenomena presented in an otherwise real-world or mundane 
       setting, commonly found in novels and dramatic performances: Despite including certain magic elements, 
       it is generally considered to be a different genre from fantasy because magical realism uses a substantial 
       amount of realistic detail and employs magical elements to make a point about reality, while fantasy 
       stories are often separated from reality. Magical realism is often seen as an amalgamation of real and 
       magical elements that produces a more inclusive writing form than either literary realism or fantasy.
